# Fireworks

Creates a small canvas on a webpage and draws some stars (that twinkle), mountains  and randomly fires some fireworks.

[I should like to add that the fireworks are simply  coloured circles that  fade over time. I wouldn't want to get anyones hopes up just  yet, though I will be making them fancier in due course.]

## To do:

* [ ] Rockets be taller and skinny
* [ ] Wavering rocket path
* [ ] Rocket trails
* [ ] Add acceleration into rockets
* [ ] Add fuel to power rocket lifespan

* [X] Make explosions look like explosions
* [ ] Have multiple explosion styles

* [ ] Option to synchronise fireworks
* [ ] Ground fireworks
* [ ] Catherine wheels

* [ ] Auto generated buildings instead of hills
* [ ] buildings to have random lit windows
* [ ] Comets in the sky
